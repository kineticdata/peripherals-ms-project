=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a REST call Microsoft Project Online to the Project Server
API to create a project in MS Project. After authenticating against the 
Project Server using the inputted username and password, the handler first makes 
a call to Project to get a FormDigestValue which is needed as a part of the 
authentication for future calls. That value is then used along with the inputted
parameters for the Enterprise Project Type and Name to make a POST request to 
the API to create the project while returning the id for the new project. Any 
errors that occur during this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler.
