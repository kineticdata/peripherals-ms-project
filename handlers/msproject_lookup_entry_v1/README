== MSProject_Lookup_Entry
This handler looks up a value in a Microsoft Project lookup table.

=== Parameters
[Lookup Table]
  The name of the table where the entry is located.
[Lookup Entry]
  The name of the entry that you want to look up.

=== Results
[Entry Id]
  The id of the entry that corresponds to the Lookup Table and Lookup Entry

==== Sample Configuration
Lookup Table:                   Internal Priority
Lookup Entry:                   Very High

=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a REST call to the Microsoft Project REST API to lookup a
GUID corresponding to a Lookup Table and a Lookup Entry Value. After authenticating 
against the Project Server using the inputted username and password, the handler 
makes a call to Project to get the id that corresponds to the lookup table name. 
A second call is then made to the specific lookup table to get the id for the
lookup entry. The id for that entry is then returned. Any errors that occur 
during this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler.
