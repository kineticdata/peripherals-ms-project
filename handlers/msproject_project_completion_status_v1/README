=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a REST call Microsoft Project Online to the Project Server
API to check a project's completion status in MS Project. After authenticating 
against the Project Server using the inputted username and password, the handler 
makes a call to Project to get the project object corresponding to the inputted
id. The list of completion stage names in the info values are then compared
against the stage of the project that was returned to determine the projects
completion status. Any errors that occur during this process will be caught and
re-raised by the handler.
