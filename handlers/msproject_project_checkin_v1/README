Project Id:                  ac9f07a3-9cd6-45b9-bff4-940294439b40

=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a REST call Microsoft Project Online to the Project Server
API to check a project back into MS Project. After authenticating against the 
Project Server using the inputted username and password, the handler first makes 
a call to Project to get a FormDigestValue which is needed as a part of the 
authentication for future calls. That value is then used along with the Project
Id parameter to make a POST request to the API to check the project in. Any 
errors that occur during this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler.
