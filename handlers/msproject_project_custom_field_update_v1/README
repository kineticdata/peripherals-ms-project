=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a REST call Microsoft Project Online to the Project Server
API to update a single custom field for a project in MS Project. After 
authenticating against the Project Server using the inputted username and 
password, the handler first makes a call to Project to get a FormDigestValue
which is needed as a part of the authentication for future calls. A second
call is then made to retrieve a list of the custom fields that are being used
on the server, so that the field display name can be converted to a id for the
final call. Lastly, the information is collected from the previous calls to make
the call to Project to actually update the custom field. Any errors that occur
during this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler.
