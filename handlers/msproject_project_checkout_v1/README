Project Id:                   15da1d25-5eb1-4dea-96eb-76664ace6515

=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a REST call Microsoft Project Online to the Project Server
API to check out project from MS Project. After authenticating against the 
Project Server using the inputted username and password, the handler first makes 
a call to Project to get a FormDigestValue which is needed as a part of the 
authentication for future calls. That value is then used along with the Project 
Id parameter to make a POST request to the API to check out the project. Any 
errors that occur during this process will be caught and re-raised by the handler.
