==== Sample Configuration
Project Id:                   68685822-4c6f-4992-8cfe-246509277072

=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a REST call Microsoft Project Online to the Project Server
API to publish a currently checked out project from MS Project. After 
authenticating against the Project Server using the inputted username and 
password, the handler first makes a call to Project to get a FormDigestValue 
which is needed as a part of the authentication for future calls. That value is 
then used along with the Project Id parameter to make a POST request to the API 
to publish the project. Any errors that occur during this process will be 
caught and re-raised by the handler.
